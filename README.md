# Python Neural Network
My first neural network in python.

## Install

Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/olegmisar/python-neural-network.git
```

If you want to train a neural network download
[train](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv)
and
[test](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv)
datasets and put them in the project root.

## How to run

### Interactive mode

Run:
```
python pygamedigittest.py
```

Python will open a pygame window where you can draw digits. Results will be logged into the console. Click right mouse button to clear the window.

### Train

To train a network run:
```
python main.py
```

Wait a couple of minutes and after that you will be prompted to save the weights.
